<h3>Water</h3>
<p>Firstly note that a hydrated body burns fat at a higher rate when compared to a dehydrated body – by miles!</p>
<p>It is so important that your body remains hydrated throughout the course of the plan and moving forwards.</p>
<p>Aim to consume <b>3.75 litres of water</b> daily in order to ensure the body remains hydrated pre, during and post high intensity exercise. Please note this is in ADDITION to things like green tea, protein drinks etc. Sometimes you can feel a little bloated at first (it won’t last though) getting used to this new amount but believe me your body needs it.</p>
<p>It is of the highest importance that during your workouts and first thing upon rising in the morning you hydrate.</p>
<br>
<h3>Other drinks</h3>
<p>Feel free to drink green tea throughout the day. You can also drink fruit and herbal teas providing they do not contain more than 1g sugar per serving.</p>
<p>If you want to have coffee please limit to 1-2 cup(s) per day and ensure no sugar is added. If you drink too much coffee your body can become reliant on the caffeine. Please use WHOLE MILK to maximise the natural goodness of un-processed milk.</p>
<p>You are permitted 1-2 diet soft drinks (i.e. diet coke, coke zero etc.) per day if you wish – drinking more than this will not affect fat loss but it’s not great for the gut.</p>
<br>
<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p><b>SPECIAL NOTE:</b> You won’t like to hear is but Alcohol could be the one thing holding you back from getting the body you want.</p>
<p>Unlike macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, alcohol supplies what I often refer to as empty calories: calories without nutrition. To make matters worse, it is the first fuel to be used when combined with carbohydrates, fats and proteins, postponing the fat-burning process and contributing to greater fat storage. Try your best to cut out alcohol as much possible while on the plan. However, life is for living and it’s important to enjoy nights out so if you do decide to have a drink do not panic. Get back on it the next day and win!</p>
