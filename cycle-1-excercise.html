<h3>HIIT</h3>
<p>HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) is an intregral part to this and needs to be carried out as detailed below in order for the fat loss to be maximised.</p>
<p>HIIT is a specialised form of interval training that involves short intervals of maximum intensity exercise separated by longer intervals of low to moderate intensity exercise. Because it involves briefly pushing yourself beyond the upper end of your aerobic exercise zone, it offers you several advantages that the low intensity cardio doesn’t and takes a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Its main purpose during CYCLE ONE is to improve fitness, melt away fat and increase the amount of calories you burn post workout – this is known as the after burn which ramps up your metabolic rate for sometimes up to 18 hours!</p>
<p>The great thing about ths cycle is that you get to choose the method of HIIT you enjoy the most. It can be applied to any piece of cardio equiment at the gym such as - Bike, Treadmill, Boxing Bag, Cross Trainer, Rower etc.</p>
<p>If you do not belong to a gym then you can use body weight exercises such as mountain climbers, burpees, star jumps and sprinting on the spot. The key here is to elevate your heart rate as much possible. Alernatively if you do enjoy classes such as cross fit, body pump, spin or circuits these will also count as a HIIT session so feel free to add them in to your training. Remember it’s one or the other DO NOT do two sessions per day.</p>
<p>Your HIIT Session should last no longer than 25 mins with 5 min warm up and 5 min cool down. This may not seem like enough to you but trust me if you train hard enough then it really is enough to melt your body fat.</p>
