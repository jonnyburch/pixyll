### Ingredients 

_1 serving_

* 18g coconut oil 
* 70g onion chopped 
* 295g chopped tomatoes 
* 1 tsp. soft brown sugar 
* Few sprigs thyme, leaves stripped 
* 1 tsp turmeric 
* 1 tsp coriander 
* 2 cod loins â€“ ROUGHLY 215G IN TOTAL 

* 180g raw Spinach/kale/beans/asparagus or broccoli 

* 85g cornmeal 
* 295ml water

### Method 

For sauce: In a medium sized sauce pan gently fry onions in coconut oil for 5 mins add the stripped thyme leaves, turmeric and coriander and fry for a further 1 minute. Add chopped tomatoes and sugar and simmer for 10 mins. Season with salt and pepper. 

For polenta: Simply add cornmeal to boiling water and continue stirring for 8-10 mins until it thickens. Season with salt and some more thyme.

To serve: Place the cod into the sauce and poach lightly for 8-10 minutes until it starts to flake. Serve on top on polenta with tomato sauce and greens on the side. 

_Tips: Add chilli and lemon zest to the polenta for added flair. Polenta will set hard. Make a batch and slice into portion size._
