### Ingredients 

_1 serving_

* 335g Lean Beef Mince Meat
* 2 tsp mixed herbs 
* 2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 14g coconut oil 
* 70g chopped red onion 
* 1 clove minced garlic 
* 85g mushrooms 
* 2 tbsp Waldens Farm BBQ Sauce â€“ Can purchase from Amazon. 

* 180g raw Spinach/kale/beans/asparagus or broccoli 
* 1 egg

### Method 

For mince: In a bowl combine mince, mixed herbs and paprika. Heat a medium sized frying pan and add half the coconut oil. Make mince into a big flat burger and brown on both sides. 

Heat another non-stick pan to a medium heat add the rest of the coconut oil, gently fry the onions and mushrooms for 4-5 mins before adding the garlic. Break up the burger into the vegetables and add a splash of water and Waldens BBQ sauce.

To serve: Serve mince with greens and one fried egg. 

_Tips: By cooking the mince separate to the vegetables you build better flavours and will save meat drying out._
