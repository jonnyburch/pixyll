--- 

### Ingredients 

_1 serving_

* 315g Chicken Breast

* 2 long thin strips of aubergine 
* 75g pepper chopped 
* 70g white onion chopped 
* Handful fresh oregano 

* 1 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1 tsp garlic powder 
* 75ml Coconut Milk 

* 18g Coconut Oil 
* 170g raw Spinach/kale/beans/asparagus or broccoli

### Method 

Preheat oven to 220 Â°C. 

For marinade: In a bowl mix paprika, garlic powder and coconut milk. Allow chicken to marinade over night.

For chicken: Split chicken lengthways, leaving one side attached so it opens out like a book. Fill the chicken with peppers, onion and oregano so you can still fold over chicken. 

Cut aubergine lengthways thin enough so it can bend. Roll the stuffed chicken breast in the aubergine, so the aubergine is wrapped around the breast. 

Drizzle with coconut oil and cook in oven for 20-25 mins. 

To serve: Serve with greens of your choice.
