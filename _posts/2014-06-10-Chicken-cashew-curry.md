### Method 

For paste: Put the ginger, garlic, chilli and coriander stalks in a small food processor and blitz, add coconut oil to help blend to a smooth paste. 

For sauce: Heat a large pan to a medium heat and add the paste, cook for 3-4 minutes. Then add the onions and garam masala and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add tinned tomatoes, chicken stock and cashews bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer, cook for 10-15 minutes. Finely slice chicken and poach in sauce for 4-5 mins or until cooked. 

To serve: Stir yoghurt through sauce scatter the coriander leaves and serve with greens. If going to freeze don’t add the yoghurt add after reheating. 

_Tips: Use a stick blender if you haven’t got a food processor. Cook greens in sauce with the chicken._
