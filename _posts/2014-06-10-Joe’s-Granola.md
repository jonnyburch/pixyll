### Ingredients 

This has been put in place to be used sparingly and not a staple meal of the 90 Day SSS Plan. If you don’t perform your training fasted in the morning and therefore eat breakfast from the Reduced Carbohydrate list then this can be used BUT try to limit to a few times per week ideally. I encourage everyone to break away from the norm of cereals and eat meat, fats and veg.

_16 servings_

* 795g Oats 
* 355g Puffed rice 
* 100g Oat bran 
* 4 tsp Cinnamon 

* 250ml Low sugar Pineapple juice 
* 175ml Low sugar Apple juice 
* 175g Sukrin Gold
* 47ml coconut oil – however feel free to use olive oil if you prefer 

* 55g Sliced & toasted almonds 
* 65g Pumpkin seeds 
* 65g Flax seeds 
* 265g Total 0% Fat Free Greek Yoghurt – to be served with each 1 portion.

### Method 

Preheat oven to 180 °C. 

For granola liquid: In a medium sized saucepan add the pineapple juice, apple juice, sukrin gold and oil. Bring this mix to the boil and continue to simmer so the liquid begins to reduce and thicken about 5-10 mins. Allow to cool slightly. 

For granola: In a big mixing bowl combine the oats, puffed rice, oat bran and cinnamon. When the granola liquid has cooled mix through the oats mix. Line a baking tray with non-stick paper, evenly spread mix about ½ and inch thick. Cook in over for 35-40 mins. Keep an eye on it as it may burn. Give it a good mix every 5-10 mins. Continue cooking if mix still feels a little soggy. 

When cooked leave to cool, break up into chunk’s and mix through almonds, pumpkin seeds and flax seeds. Store in an air tight container. 

To serve: Add 1 portion to a bowl and serve with the greek yoghurt.
