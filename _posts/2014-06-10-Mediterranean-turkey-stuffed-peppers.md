### Ingredients 

_2 servings_

* 4 red/yellow peppers (2 peppers = 1 portion. When cut this is the same as 4 halves)

* 18g coconut oil 
* 495g Extra Lean Turkey Mince 
* 230g onion diced 
* 85g mushrooms sliced 
* 2 tsp dried cumin 
* 1 garlic clove minced 
* 25ml soy sauce 
* 645g chopped tomatoes 
* 1 tbsp tomato puree 
* Handful of fresh oregano 

* 106g grated mozzarella

### Method 

Preheat oven to 200 Â°C. 

For peppers: Cut the peppers lengthways down the middle including the stalk and carefully scrape out the seeds and pith. Rub the peppers with coconut oil and place on a baking tray and in the oven for 20 mins.

For stuffing: In a medium sized frying pan over a medium heat add coconut oil and gently fry the onions for 2-3 mins then add the mushrooms, garlic and cumin cook for a further 2-3. Add the turkey mince, chopped tomatoes, tomato puree, soy sauce and oregano mix well in the pan and simmer for 10mins. 

To serve: Fill the peppers with the stuffing and grate over mozzarella. Flash under the grill to melt cheese and serve. 

_Tips: Try not to overcook the peppers as they will collapse and lose their shape. Freeze the mince separately and just fill peppers with hot mince._
