### Ingredients 

_1 serving_

* 315g Chicken breast, cut into strips
* 2 tsp Cajun Spice 

* 85g Broccoli cut into small florets 
* 65g green pepper, sliced 
* 70g red pepper, sliced 
* 70g onion sliced 

* 1 Clove garlic, diced 
* 30ml tablespoon Soy sauce 
* 2 tbsp Cholula hot sauce 
* A pinch of Splenda granules

* 18g coconut oil

### Method 

For sauce: In a small bowl add the garlic, soy sauce, Cholula and Splenda and mix. 

For stir fry: Cut chicken into thin strips, season with Cajun spice and salt and pepper.

Heat a large frying pan/wok to medium to high heat, warm the coconut oil then add the onions and peppers, fry for 3-4 mins until softened. Turn up the heat and add chicken and broccoli, cook for a further 4-6 mins until chicken is cooked. 

To serve: When chicken is cooked stir through sauce and serve immediately. 

_Tips: Add a splash of water to pan to create a little more sauce. Don’t feel afraid to experiment with spices. It won’t change the macro nutrients we are after._
