### Ingredients 

_Makes 2 big burgers (Two servings) 1 BURGER PER PORTION_

* 510g Extra Lean Turkey Mince 
* Salt, pepper 
* 65g Red Onion or white onion diced 
* 1 egg 
* 1 apple – skin removed and grated 
* 3 tsp dried oregano 
* 335g sweet potato (this is for one portion) 
* 3 tsp paprika 
* 2 tsp dried coriander 
* 12g coconut oil 
* 125g raw spinach/kale/beans/asparagus or broccoli

### Method 

Preheat oven to 220 °C. 

For burger: In a big bowl mix turkey mince, onion, egg, apple, oregano, 1 tsp paprika and season with Salt and pepper. Shape into 2 burgers and gently fry until golden brown. Cooking in oven for 15-20mins depending on thickness. 

For wedges: Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Cut Sweet potato into preferred wedge size. Carefully drop into boiling water, remove wedges when water comes back up to the boil. Let the wedges steam then gently toss with coconut oil, paprika and dried coriander. Spread wedges out on tray making sure there is space between and roast in oven for 20-25 mins at 220 °C until nice and crispy.

To serve: Serve wedges and burger with choice of greens. 

Tips: Part boiling potato in the method above works on any size potato. Smaller potato faster to the boil – larger potato longer to boil.
