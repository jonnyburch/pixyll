### Ingredients 

_2 servings (4 fishcakes)_

* 340g pink salmon (tinned) drained 
* 75g spring onion finely diced 
* 2 cloves crushed garlic 
* 1 lemon (juice and zest) 
* 1 whole egg + 1 egg white 
* 65g of ground golden/cold milled flaxseeds 
* Handful of fresh parsley 

* 230g LOW FAT cottage cheese 
* 112g avocado

### Method 

For fish cakes: Mix salmon, spring onion, garlic, lemon, eggs, flaxseed and parsley in a bowl and combine well. Let the mix sit for a few minutes so the flax soaks up a lot of the liquid. 

Warm a medium sized frying pan, shape your mix into 4 patties and fry gently until golden brown. 

To serve: Serve your fish cakes with LOW FAT cottage cheese and avocado. 

_Tips: Shape the patties and allow to sit in fridge for 10-15 mins, will hold their shape better. Substitute salmon for tuna._
