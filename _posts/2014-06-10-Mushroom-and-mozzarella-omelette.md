--- 

### Ingredients 

_1 serving_

* 4 medium eggs 
* 1 egg white 
* 75g button mushrooms 
* 12g coconut oil 
* 53g Grated Mozzarella 
* 180g raw Spinach/kale/beans/asparagus or broccoli

### Method 

Turn on grill 

For omelette: In a bowl Mix eggs and season with salt and pepper. 

Heat a medium sized non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Cook thinly sliced mushrooms in coconut oil for 2-3 mins. Reduce heat and add egg mix. 

Gently move around egg mix so it covers the pan, cook for 1-2 mins until egg is almost cooked. Sprinkle grated mozzarella and finish under the grill. 

To serve: If feeling brave fold omelette in half and serve immediately with greens.

_Tips: When cooking mushrooms try not to move them around as it will knock out all the flavour. Turn one or two times max._
