### Ingredients 

_2 servings_

* 630g chicken breast 
* 30ml extra-virgin olive oil 
* 1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder 

* 175g Fresh orange (weight after skin removed) 
* 515g mixed Asian or salad greens 
* 205g red pepper cut into thin strips 
* 5ml cider vinegar 
* 30g Dijon mustard

### Method 

Preheat oven to 220 Â°C 

For chicken: In a small bowl marinade the chicken with Chinese 5 spice and a little of the oil. The rest will be needed for the dressing. Place on baking tray lined with tin foil and cook for 20-25 mins curl up edges of foil to collect juice. Once cooked allow to rest for 5 mins. 

For dressing: Peel and thinly slice the oranges collecting as much juice as possible. In a small mixing bowl mix Dijon mustard, cider vinegar, orange juice and the remaining oil. 

To serve: Mix the orange slices with the greens and peppers and toss with the dressing. Slice the chicken and gently mix through.

_Tips: Use some of the juices from the chicken for extra flavour._
