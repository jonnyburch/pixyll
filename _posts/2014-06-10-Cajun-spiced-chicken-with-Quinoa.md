### Method 

Preheat oven to 180 °C. 

For chicken: Marinade chicken and peppers with coconut oil then rub in Cajun seasoning, place on baking tray lined with tin foil and cook for 20-25 mins curl up edges of foil to collect juice. Once cooked allow to rest for 5 mins.

For quinoa: Lightly toast Quinoa in a saucepan until it starts to pop. (Adds a nutty flavour). Add water and bring to boil then simmer for 15 mins, add apricots and cook for a further 5 mins. Drain any remaining water and allow to steam. 

To serve: Fluff Quinoa in a bowl with a fork and add zest and juice of lemon, grated nutmeg, finely chopped spring onions, coriander, roasted peppers and stir through cooking juices from the chicken. Slice chicken and lay on a bed of the quinoa. 

Tips: Cook multiple things in a tray to save washing and combine flavours.
