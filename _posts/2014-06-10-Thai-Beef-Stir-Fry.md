For stir fry: Have everything ready as this cooks quick. Slice your mushrooms, thinly slice peppers, mange tout can stay whole, split asparagus down the middle lengthways and dice spring onions.

In a large hot frying pan add the sesame oil and coconut oil and go straight in with the beef, after about 3-4 mins it should be crispy and brown. Now add all your vegetables along with the ginger, chilli and garlic. Add a splash of water and cook for a maximum of 2 minutes. 

To serve: In the final 30 seconds of cooking add soy sauce, oyster sauce and vinegar. Serve immediately. 

_Tips: Keep the heat high and cook it quick to keep beef medium rare and stop the vegetables going soggy._
